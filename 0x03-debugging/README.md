### 0x03-debugging

## In this project, I learned how to debug manually others people programs.

# Descriptions of the tasks:

0. In this project, I just replace a variable to test the ouput of a function.

1. In this project, I used comments in order to avoid an infinite loop.

2. In this project, I debugged a program who prints the largest of three
   integers.

3. In this project, I debugged a program who converts a date to the day of year
   and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into
consideration.
