In this project, I learned the base of C and the commands : gcc, printf, puts, putchar, sizeof

This is the descriptif of the scripts and the C programs I made :

0 - This script create preprocessed code in a file called c based on $CFILE=main.c

1 - This script create object (.o) code ready to be ready to be linked

2 - This script compile assembled code (.s) to IR Code

3 - This script create a executable file called cisfun based on the C code on the variable $CFILE

4 - This program prints a sentence using the function puts()

5 - This program prints a sentence using the function printf()

6 - This program prints several lines with the size in bytes of various types of data

100 - This script compile assembled code (.s) to IR code using Intel syntax

101 - This program prints a sentence using the function fwrite
