# 0x14-bit_manipulation

## In this project, I learned about bit manipulation.

### Description of the tasks:

0. Converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

1. Prints the binary representation of a number.

2. Return the value of a bit at a given index.

3. Sets the value of a bit to 1 at given index.

4. Sets the value of a bit to 0 at given index.

5. Returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
