## C programming

## This repository is containing all the C programs I made at Holberton School.

In order to execute them, you have to compile the with **gcc** with the flags *-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89*.

```sh
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 "filename.c" -o "executable name"
```

All the programs are using [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki) coding style in order to make the code clean for everyone.
